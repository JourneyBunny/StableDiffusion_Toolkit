Simple toolkit for generating an image with Stable Diffusion, then brushing a mask and infilling with a prompt.

You create a free huggingface account to generate a token that can download the models from the site.
SD 3+ Likely requires actually visiting the model's website and clicking Accept on the ToS before this tool can use your token to download the model.
